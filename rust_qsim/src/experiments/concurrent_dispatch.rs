/** This should run send ping pong messages between multiple nodes. The structure looks like the following

    0    1
     \  /
      4
     / \
    2   3

 Nodes 0,1,3,4 can send messages to 2 and 2 can send messages to any other node. So, each node has to
 have a Sender to 2, and 2 has to have a Sender to all the other nodes.

 This example is to figure out how to wire up the channels.

 Notes1: The senders must be dropped on the main thread so that the ref-counter reaches 0 once the
 Dispatcher drops all the senders when it goes out of scope.

 Note2: Currently the dispatcher-thread decides that it wants to end execution. All the sending-ends
        it holds are dropped and the relay threads receive an error while waiting for receiver.recv.
        Alternatively one could introduce some 'Terminate' message, which lets the
        other parties terminate. To avoid doing regular program flow with an error. - Don't know whether
        that is a valid thing to do in Rust yet -.
